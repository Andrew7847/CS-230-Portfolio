# CS-230-Portfolio

1.
This design project was for the client The Gaming Room, a game company that has a successful mobile game called "Draw It or Lose It". The client requested we build a web-based version of their existing game which could be played on multiple platforms such as Mac, Windows, Linux, etc. 

2.
One thing I did particularly well with the design documentation was the summary of the advantages and disadvantages of each operating platform which would help the client ultimately decide which platform the game would be developed on. 

3.
The process of working through the design documentation caused me to have to go back and more thoroughly understand the process of how a distributed application would be designed and implemented which ultimately caused my code to be more efficient and significantly cleaner.

4.
Going back over the documentation, if I could revise one particular spot it would be the recommendations portion as I feel as though I did not adequately explain my reasoning behind the operating platform choice. Although it was a decent explanation for someone at my level, it could be better. 

5.
The user wanted am application that was multi-platform capable and that is why the application was designed without any platform-specific code and was versatile. The user also wanted to be able to scale the game to their needs and the code and storage/memory recommendations allow for that. If you do not consider the client's needs then you might as well not bother wasting time even attempting to create something for them because they will likely be extremely unhappy with the results.

6.
The strategy I used for designing the software was first carefully reading through the client's needs multiple times to make sure I did not miss anything, followed by creating a UML class diagram to match those needs. I would then compare the two and add or remove anything from the UML diagram as necessary. From there, the coding is quite simple as I extrapolate from the UML diagram and, once again, revisit the client's needs to make sure nothing was missed. This seemed to be a solid strategy that worked will and will likely work well again in the future.
